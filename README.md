Adapted from [the official Ender 3 PrusaSlicer configs](https://github.com/sn4k3/Ender3/blob/master/PrusaSlicer/printer/Creality%20Ender-3%20Stock.ini) with modifications to support [EZABL](https://www.th3dstudio.com/product/ezabl-pro-plug-print-auto-bed-leveling-kit/).

Feel free to make tweaks and submit pull requests! For major changes, it's recommended to print a calibration object such as a [Benchy](http://www.3dbenchy.com/) to demonstrate that the profile settings perform well.
